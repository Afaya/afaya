### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## We are [Afaya](http://afaya.es/#/home). And we are really happy that you have reached us. 

Here we are going to tell you somethings about us:
- ðŸ‘¯ We are a non-profitable association, and we do different things (organize events, give talks, prepare workshops for kids, write books...) .

- ðŸ’¬ We are eager to help you specially if you are organizing an event, workshop, talk or whatever to help kids starting on tech, or under-represented groups. Also if you need help, or mentoring, we are always keen to talk and help, if we can.

- ðŸ”­ We love to develop different pet projects, usually on Typescript, IoT or C#. We also take care about accesibility, and we are trying to learn more about it.

- ðŸŒ± We also organize the [Asturias NetConf](http://afaya.es/asturiasNetConf/) since 2019, one day event to talk about Microsoft Technologies on Asturias.

- âš¡ We are very worried about anxiety on the tech environment, for this reason on January 2020 with the help of a lot of collaborators we have published [TecnÃ³logues del montÃ³n](https://github.com/Afaya/Libro-Tecnologues-del-monton)

- ðŸ˜„ You can take a look at some of our talks on our channel on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCquXr5RdNtEadLOUwucFbzQ/playlists).
